          <p class="lead">Hi, My name is Jon</p>
          <p>
            Welcome to my hub on the web. In these days of ubiquitous social
            networks it is more important than ever to maintain your own hub on
            the web under your direct control. Many of us who are early adopters√ß
            of technology have been burned when a much loved service has been
            turned down. While the nice people at Facebook and Google (and
            others) have welcomed you into their social networks, they also are
            the only ones with the keys. Your presence there is at their whim.
            Having your own presence is more important now than ever.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here is where I come in. While you may agree with me about having a
            presence, not everyone has the skills to do so. Luckily I do.
            Working together we can get you your own little corner of the
            Internet.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">Technology is mastering a million easy things</p>
          <p>
            What I do is listen to your needs and craft them into solutions. I
            take care of the million nitty-gritty technical challenges that you
            face so that you can take care of what matters most to you.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">Hard won experience</p>
          <p>
            I have worked for some of the largest corporations in the world and
            came through with flying colours. I have also helped many small
            businesses and people with their small corner of the Internet. From
            boardrooms to the helpdesk I can deal with everyone involved.
            Balance in all things is essential to ensuring projects run
            smoothly.
