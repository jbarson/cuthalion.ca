      <div className="About">
        <p>Welcome to my hub on the web. In these days of ubiquitous social networks it is more important than ever to maintain your own hub on the web under your direct control. Many of us who are early adopters of technology have been burned when a much loved service has been turned down. While the nice people at Facebook and Google (and others) have welcomed you into their social networks, they also are the only ones with the keys. Your presence there is at their whim. Having your own presence is more important now than ever.</p>
        <p>Here is where I come in. While you may agree with me about having a presence, not everyone has the skills to do so. Luckily I do. Working together we can get you your own little corner of the Internet.</p>
        <h2 className="heading">Technology is mastering a million easy things</h2>
        <p>What I do is listen to your needs and craft them into solutions. I take care of the million nitty-gritty technical challenges that you face so that you can take care of what matters most to you.</p>
        <h2 className="heading">Hard won experience</h2>
        <p>I have worked for some of the largest corporations in the world and came through with flying colours. I have also helped many small businesses and people with their small corner of the Internet. From boardrooms to the helpdesk I can deal with everyone involved. Balance in all things is essential to ensuring projects run smoothly.</p>
